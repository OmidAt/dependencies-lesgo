SUMMARY:

   The  purpose  of fpx3 is to simplify Fortran source code develop­
   ment with an integrated set of macros,  directives  and  embedded
   Perl/Fortran.   Most  common tasks can be done without Perl back­
   ground using the documented examples.  For  sophisticated  source
   code  transformations  Perls broad functionality can be used. Em­
   bedded Fortran can  be  used  for  general  data  initialization.
   There  is  support for Fortran context sensitive macros and local
   name spaces.  Structural and dependency  information  for  subse­
   quent tools can be generated.

INSTALL:

   Fpx3 requires perl5. You can find out the installed Perl version
   with `perl -v`. On unix systems you may have to adjust the first
   line of the fpx3 script so that it points to the Perl interpreter.
   On Windows systems it is simplest to call fpx3 as `perl fpx3` or
   generate fpx3.bat with pl2bat that comes with ActivePerl.
